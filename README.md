## Endpoints
### Endpoint: Process Receipts
#### POST /receipts/process

* Response: JSON containing an id for the receipt.

**Description:**

Takes in a JSON receipt and returns a JSON object with an ID generated by your code.

{
  "retailer": "Target",

  ],

}
```

**Example Response:**
```json
{ "id": "7fb1377b-b223-49d9-a31a-5a02701dd310" }
```

### Endpoint: Get Points
#### GET /receipts/{id}/points
* Live Path: `https://frosty-meadow-6954.fly.dev/receipts/{id}/points`
* Local Path: `http://localhost:3000/receipts/{id}/points`
* Path: `/receipts/{id}/points`
* Method: `GET`
* Response: A JSON object containing the number of points awarded.

A simple Getter endpoint that looks up the receipt by the ID and returns an object specifying the points awarded.

**Example Response:**
```json
{ "points": 32 }
```
How many points should be earned are defined by the rules below.
* One point for every alphanumeric character in the retailer name.
* 50 points if the total is a round dollar amount with no cents.
* 25 points if the total is a multiple of `0.25`.
* 5 points for every two items on the receipt.
* If the trimmed length of the item description is a multiple of 3, multiply the price by `0.2` and round up to the nearest integer. The result is the number of points earned.
* 6 points if the day in the purchase date is odd.
* 10 points if the time of purchase is after 2:00pm and before 4:00pm.
